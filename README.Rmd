# glider_pilot_tools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of glider_pilot_tools is to provide glider pilots with additional information about vehicle health and science data. As well, it is a shareable platform built on R Shiny that can be used to keep non-pilot collaborators informed of mission progress without having to grant access to the piloting server.
