# glider_pilot_tools

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of glider_pilot_tools is to provide glider pilots with additional information about vehicle health and science data. As well, it is a shareable platform built on R Shiny that can be used to keep non-pilot collaborators informed of mission progress without having to grant access to the piloting server.

Minimal sbdlist requirements for full features:

```         
c_wpt_lat              #at least once per surfacing interval
c_wpt_lon              #at least once per surfacing interval
m_present_time         #as frequent as possible
m_coulomb_amphr_total  #at least once per surfacing interval
m_gps_lat              #as frequently as possible (only writes with gps lock)
m_gps_lon              #as frequently as possible (only writes with gps lock)
m_leakdetect*          #as often as desired
```

Minimum tbdlist requirements:

```         
sci_m_present_time     #as frequent as possible
sci_water_conductivity #as often as desired
sci_water_temperature  #as often as desired
sci_water_pressure     #as often as desired
```

Able to process intermediate and full data \*bd and \*cd files.

Requires [osgUtils](https://github.com/oceanscienceguru/osgUtils) R package to function.
